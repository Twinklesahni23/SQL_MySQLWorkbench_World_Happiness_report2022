The World Happiness Report is a publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various (quality of) life factors. The report primarily uses data from the Gallup World Poll. The rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The report correlates the life evaluation results with various life factors.

The Happiness Score is explained by the following factors:
1. GDP per capita
2. Healthy Life Expectancy
3. Social support
4. Freedom to make life choices
5. Generosity
6. Corruption Perception

The data has been taken from kaggle dataset which can be accessed from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report).
